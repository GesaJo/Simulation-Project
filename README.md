# Simulation-Project: Supermarket

This program simulates a supermarket where 20 people are allowed to go shoppping at the same time - similar to how many supermarkets operate under the current circumstances (due to the corona-virus).

The EDA is rather for giving an overview over the data and generating ideas for further analyses.


This simulation of a Supermarket has been created in week 8 at Spiced Academy.

# To do: 
- Fix bugs: random colors, customers not turning red at checkout
